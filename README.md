# Amazon Recommender System with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

Welcome to the **Amazon Recommender System** project! This repository implements a recommendation system for Amazon products using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. The system goes beyond traditional recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering by leveraging advanced graph-based methods to uncover deeper insights into user-product interactions.

## üìå Overview

### Motivation
Recommendation systems play a vital role in personalizing user experiences. Amazon's ability to recommend products effectively relies on advanced algorithms. This project explores **Graph Neural Networks** to simulate such a system.

### Highlights
- Built using the **Amazon 2018 dataset** with a subset processed using the **5-kcore** method.
- Utilizes **GraphSAGE** and **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** for node embeddings and aggregation.
- Benchmarked against traditional models like **KNN** and **SVD**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - **Nodes**: Users and products.
   - **Edges**: 
     - `Reviews`: Connect users to products with ratings.
     - `Also Bought`: Connect products frequently purchased together.

2. **Node Embeddings**:
   - **Product Nodes**: Generated using `sentence-transformer/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for descriptions and one-hot encoded categories.
   - **User Nodes**: Initialized as blank and updated dynamically based on interactions.

3. **GNN Models**:
   - **GraphSAGE**: Learns inductive representations of nodes.
   - **GAT**: Assigns attention weights to neighbors for better aggregation.

4. **Explainability**:
   - Integrated gradients via **Captum** to interpret model predictions.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - **Metric**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Comparison against traditional methods and a state-of-the-art Graph-based Hybrid Recommendation System (GHRS).
