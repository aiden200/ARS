Please install the required packages by creating a virtual environment with python version 3.9, and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Once the requirements are installed, all the cells within `ARS.ipynb` should run fine. Due to the large amount of data in the dataset, depending on your computer specs it might take a long time. If the kernel is crashing, the computer has ran out of memory. We ran this code with a GeForce RTX 4090 with 64GB of RAM and 24GB of VRAM. 

The data is already downloaded in the repository, so there is no need to uncomment the data collection line within the notebook.
